I'm lazy and I didn't create any backend for this. This whole site runs as a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/ ">Jekyll</a> blog.

If you have no idea how to do these steps described below feel free to <a href="/adriano.galello.html">contact me</a> and I will do it for you.

(I know it's not the best way, but I'm just getting started ðŸ¤—)

<h2 class="is-size-3">Fork the repo</h2>
Fork the repository <a href="https://github.com/"></a> by clicking the Fork button on the top right corner. Forking means that you now copied this whole project and all the files into your account.

<h2 class="is-size-3">Create your profile</h2>
Go to the **_posts** folder and add your profile like this:

**YYYY-MM-DD-YOUR-FULL-NAME.md**
