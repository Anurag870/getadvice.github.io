This site offers a list of people that are willing to donate part of their time to help people struggling with some tech or product issues.

<h2 class="is-size-3">How does it work?</h2>
Search through the list of people by looking at their skills and knowledge to find someone that matches your needs. You can look at their Blog, LinkedIn profiles, or twitter to find out more about her or him.
It’s important to pay attention to their location and languages to make sure you timezones or languages won’t be a problem
Once you find the right candidate, **schedule a call** with him. All candidates publish their calendars with possibles dates and times when they are free to talk. After that, she or he will confirm the appointment and sent you a link to a videoconference platform to have the call.

<h2 class="is-size-3">Do I have to pay for the candidate's services?</h2>
No, although a candidate can ask for it if she or he wants it.

All candidates can publish a **Donate to...** button since I intend that this serves as a community that helps each other the best they can.
